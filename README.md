# expo-skeleton
While dabbling around with expo I decided I would need a basic app-skeleton so as not to start from scratch every time. You may use it for your projects of course, but you know the drill: no warranties :)

# Get started
1. Fork repository
2. Clone using git clone into your desired folder
3. Run: expo start
